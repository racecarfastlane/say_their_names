Derek Johnson is facing charges of evading arrest, speeding, driving on revoked/suspended license and a stop sign violation. According to the warrant, Johnson was behind the wheel of a gray Pontiac that was stopped for running a stop sign in Kingston on Aug. 13, 2020. Despite challenges created by the pandemic, Kingston\u2019s proposed budget for fiscal year 2021 \u2013 2022 is looking good, City Manager David Bolling told city council this week. \u201cFor the sixth year in a row, I am presenting you with a General Fund budget that is balanced with no tax increase. I\u2019m also very pleased to say that, for the fourth year in a row, this budget is balanced without the use of our fund balance. This maintains our steadfast commitment to operate this city on existing revenue,\u201d Bolling said. Rockwood Police Officer Chris Marney sprung into action when a man reported being robbed on May 7. The suspect, identified as convicted felon Samuel Johnson, was going around posing as a U.S. Marshal. He\u2019s facing 13 charges in the incident. According to warrants, Sheila Efford was outside of her Riggs Chapel Road residence with her son when Johnson showed up wearing a face mask. \u201cHe identified himself as a U.S. Marshal,\u201d the warrant said. \u201cHe asked if there were any men in the house. She told him no there wasn\u2019t.\u201d A state trooper reportedly found suspected meth, heroin and prescription pills on an intoxicated driver last week. According to warrants, Trooper Justin Hamby was dispatched to a crash on Hwy. 61 near Old Hen Valley Road on May 7. \u201cWhen arriving on scene and making contact with the driver Kayne A. Lowe, who was wearing a black t-shirt with gray sweat pants and black shoes,\u201d the warrant said. \u201cWhen talking to Mr. Lowe, he had slurred speech and constricted pupils. Mr. Lowe also seemed confused when talking to EMTs.\u201d While it is good that the county offers some level of recycling, it is interesting to find out that there was no formal written county recycling policy. What disturbs me to have read in the May 12th article \u201cNew Policy for County Recycling\u201d is that it seems all electronics are allowed to be recycled for $5/ton.", "provider": [{"_type": "Organization", "name": "Roane County"}], "datePublished": "2017-07-28T05:12:00.0000000Z", "category": "US"}, {"name": "Liberty for Whom?", "url": "https://www.thenation.com/article/culture/tyler-stovall-white-freedom/", "description": "In plainer terms, \u201cHow is it,\u201d as the English writer Samuel Johnson sardonically asked in 1775, the same year as Henry\u2019s address, \u201cthat we hear the loudest yelps for liberty among the ...", "provider": [{"_type": "Organization", "name": "The Nation"}], "datePublished": "2021-05-04T20:25:00.0000000Z"}, {"name": "Four arrested for hijacking truck load of Golden Penny flour", "url": "https://dailypost.ng/2021/05/24/four-arrested-for-hijacking-truck-load-of-golden-penny-flour/", "image": {"thumbnail": {"contentUrl": "https://www.bing.com/th?id=OVFT.hMMnCUdwbsoAEwPGHszgli&pid=News", "width": 700, "height": 393}}, "description": "Four men have been arrested for allegedly hijacking a trailer load of Golden Penny flour in Ogun State.
