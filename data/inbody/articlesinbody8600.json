C. has never had a Republican mayor, not ever.\u00a0 Folks in Washington are not allowed to dance at weddings by order of its boneheaded mayor, allegedly due to the coronavirus.\u00a0 Strippers can dance, and so can people at yoga classes, just not at weddings. Jimmy Carter was president when Americans sat for hours at the gas pump during the last gasoline shortage.\u00a0 D\u00e9j\u00e0 vu all over again!\u00a0 Joe Biden immediately killed America\u2019s position as one of the biggest energy-producers in the world, to once again make us dependent upon foreign powers, while killing hundreds of thousands of good paying jobs.\u00a0 Where are the \u201cgreen\u201d jobs Biden promised?\u00a0 Wait, many of us are still sitting in line at the gas pumps. The Carter era was also known for sky high inflation and Joe Biden appears to be Jimmy Carter 2.0. Daniel Watson, the resident social justice warrior of the Knox County Board of Education, doesn\u2019t seem to understand his role on that body or how to accomplish anything.\u00a0 For the past several weeks, Watson has been trying to pass an elaborate resolution outlining a process of his own invention to involve the community in reviewing the Memorandum of Agreement between the Knox County Sheriff\u2019s Office and the City of Knoxville Police Department to staff schools in Knoxville and Knox County.\u00a0 While it is true the school system has its own security officers, they do not carry the legal authority or the same training as either the officers from the sheriff\u2019s office and the KPD.\u00a0 In an emergency, it is the sheriff\u2019s office or the KPD that would be called and expected to respond. Watson\u2019s virtue signaling resolution included language calling for a \u201cfacilitator\u201d as well as the involvement of various groups and community involvement in reviewing the MOA.\u00a0 Doug Harris, a former chairman of the Knox County Board of Education, sent an email to every member reminding them of the process adopted by the school board at the time.\u00a0 The MOA, Harris pointed out, was the result of community hearings following the tragedies at Columbine and Sandy Hook.\u00a0 Almost certainly, Daniel Watson had no idea what went on at the time, who was involved, or that the community had had ample opportunities to speak out and give their opinions, which they did.\u00a0 Harris recalled there was not a single protest from any parent in Knoxville or Knox County in having officers from the sheriff\u2019s office or the KPD stationed at schools.\u00a0 Quite the contrary, there was an outpouring of support for the idea.\u00a0 Mike McMillan, who was on the board at the time, confirms Harris\u2019 recollection. Then a funny thing happened on the way to the meeting. Daniel Watson got run over by a bus driven by Mayor Indya Kincannon.\u00a0 Kincannon caved to the few, albeit loud, voices of the leftists who are the same folks demanding the KPD be defunded.\u00a0 Kincannon sent a letter stating she was withdrawing the 14 KPD officers inside schools.\u00a0 Thus far, to my knowledge, only one solitary member of the Knoxville City Council, Gwen McKenzie, has said she isn\u2019t crazy about Mayor Kincannon\u2019s decision.\u00a0 Kincannon reputedly never even bothered to consult the council members before making the decision.\u00a0 All heck broke loose and parents, rightly, lost their minds. Nobody would come right out and say they were for withdrawing the officers from the school.\u00a0 Some parents reminded board members Anthony Thompson Jr. did take a loaded gun into Austin-East High School as well as extra ammunition clips.\u00a0 Daniel Watson moved as fast as a scalded cat to disassociate himself from Kincannon\u2019s decision, although as far as I know, he never came out in opposition to the city mayor\u2019s actions.\u00a0\u00a0 Nor could anybody with a brain not on life support be surprised by Kincannon\u2019s backing water almost immediately.\u00a0 The city mayor\u2019s apologists in the local media attempted to say what Indya really meant was we ought to have some conversations and other meaningless tripe aside from her stated intention of withdrawing the 14 officers from the schools.\u00a0 There were references to the fact the City needs those 14 officers out on the streets.\u00a0 Well, if that is true\u2014and I do know there is a shortage of recruits in the KPD\u2014Indya has $50 million of NEW spending in her budget with mighty little to attract young men and women to a law enforcement career.\u00a0 Nope, instead Indya is spending it on social programs and hails \u201cprograms\u201d like \u201cviolence interruption.\u201d\u00a0 I wonder if they\u2019ve tried that in Chicago?\u00a0 Maybe they\u2019ll do that after the cats clean out the rats.\u00a0 Council members like Tommy Smith run around telling anybody who will listen what a great budget it is (and it will cause taxes to go up the following year), but nothing about keeping the officers in the schools.\u00a0 You\u2019d think that would be an important consideration for a young father. Indya\u2019s announcement knocked Little Dan\u2019l Watson for a loop.\u00a0 A majority of the board didn\u2019t much like the idea of his resolution and they pretty well clubbed it to death at the last meeting.\u00a0 The \u201choney badger\u201d of the board of education, Mike McMillan, who had proposed public meetings in the various districts, scoffed at the idea the board needed a facilitator.\u00a0 McMillan scolded board Vice Chair Virginia Babb, reminding her the board was elected by the people, directly responsible to the people who elected them from their respective districts, not the teachers, principals, or school bureaucracy.\u00a0 McMillan says the board leadership, Chair Susan Horn and Vice Chair Babb, were elected by the other members of the board and well able to preside at public meetings. McMillan is exactly right and Little Dan\u2019l is wrong.\u00a0 Only the board members are elected and directly accountable to the people.\u00a0 The notion the board needs a facilitator to instruct it on how to listen to the people who elected them is nothing less than idiotic.\u00a0 There is nothing to prevent people from communicating with board members to share their thoughts as it is; board members have received hundreds and hundreds of emails about the masking policy as well as school security.\u00a0 Board members have sat and listened to people pretty much endlessly. The board better keep one thing in mind: there\u2019s nothing wrong with hearing what the public thinks, but if you want a document the sheriff will sign, it\u2019s likely best not to try and hamper law enforcement professionals doing their job.\u00a0 Everybody in the country seems to be able to tell us how everything should be and how some event could have been so different if only from behind the security of their computer screen.\u00a0 Unfortunately, much of this public conversation and dialogue isn\u2019t about the charge of the school system protecting the students, faculty and staff in our schools; it\u2019s about a group of folks who want to use a tragedy, not to effect real change, but rather to win political advantage.\u00a0 After all, if you support defunding the police, there\u2019ll be NO officers on duty anywhere, much less protecting our children in schools.\u00a0 \u201cHoney Badger\u201d McMillan is right; it\u2019s time for the board to handle its own business and make its own decisions.\u00a0 The people of South Knoxville, Gibbs, Carter, Central, Halls, Karns, Powell, Hardin Valley, Farragut and Bearden have voices, too.\u00a0 Let them be heard.", "about": [{"readLink": "https://api.bing.microsoft.com/api/v7/entities/36c53949-92d8-4b8c-95c7-e92b839f90c5", "name": "Knoxville"}, {"readLink": "https://api.bing.microsoft.com/api/v7/entities/15e89beb-35f9-7d6d-862f-53fa89755766", "name": "Focus"}], "provider": [{"_type": "Organization", "name": "The Knoxville Focus", "image": {"thumbnail": {"contentUrl": "https://www.bing.com/th?id=AR_b404822fea20eddc8ddc3a2107d0262d&pid=news"}}}], "datePublished": "2021-05-17T03:09:00.0000000Z", "category": "Politics"}, {"name": "Risk of Covid-19 death for ethnic groups \u2018different in second wave\u2019", "url": "https://www.newsr.in/n/UK/1zn1t8yhin/Risk-of-Covid-19-death-for-ethnic-groups.htm", "description": "People of Bangladeshi and Pakistani ethnic backgrounds in England have had higher mortality rates during the second wave of Covid-19 than the first, while other", "about": [{"readLink": "https://api.bing.microsoft.com/api/v7/entities/d2b84def-038d-cbdf-d494-0641f64188b5", "name": "Ethnic group"}], "provider": [{"_type": "Organization", "name": "newsr.in"}], "datePublished": "2021-05-26T10:07:00.0000000Z", "category": "World"}, {"name": "Full List of 229 Black People Killed by Police Since George Floyd's Murder", "url": "https://www.newsweek.com/full-list-229-black-people-killed-police-since-george-floyds-murder-1594477", "description": "U.S. George Floyd Police Killings Police brutality Black Lives Matter At least 229 Black people have been killed by police officers across the U.S. in the year since George Floyd's murder.", "about": [{"readLink": "https://api.bing.microsoft.com/api/v7/entities/c78e0e6e-3b43-9e12-66d6-6466c9cbce54", "name": "George Floyd"}, {"readLink": "https://api.bing.microsoft.com/api/v7/entities/9e96aac3-fa49-d8b9-9310-7bfeff2cce02", "name": "Police"}, {"readLink": "https://api.bing.microsoft.com/api/v7/entities/2a0736b6-fc27-fb08-4d47-aaa6270c0bd9", "name": "Murder"}], "provider": [{"_type": "Organization", "name": "Newsweek"}], "datePublished": "2021-05-25T11:09:00.0000000Z", "category": "Politics"}, {"name": "Board OKs Body Cams for Deputies", "url": "https://www.officer.com/on-the-street/body-cameras/news/21223483/board-oks-body-cams-for-deputies", "description": "The cost would be $552,499.
