It happened early this morning at Oak Orchard Estates Mobile Home Park. Police say 62 year old Isaiah Alexander stabbed a 17 year old boy in the upper chest. The unidentified teenager was taken to Strong Hospital. A 20 year old woman suffered a severe laceration to her hand after stepping in the melee. She was taken to UMMC. Alexander has been charged with one count of attempted murder and two counts of felony assault. He\u2019s locked up in the Orleans County Jail. Thieves are at it again in Batavia. Police say they have seen an uptick in the number of thefts from parked cars, mainly during the overnight hours. One preventable reason: these cars were unlocked. Police say do not leave valuable items in a parked car\u2026and by all means, lock it up. North Bergen Road between Merrill Road and Bird Road will be closed effective immediately for approximately 2 weeks. It will not be open to local traffic. New Yorkers between the ages of 12 and 15 might not have to wait much longer before they can get vaccinated against COVID-19. State health officials say they could begin receiving shots as early as tomorrow if a federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention committee decides today to recommend the use of Pfizer vaccine for that age group. Currently, everyone 16 and older is eligible to be vaccinated. The governor says it is unlikely COVID-19 vaccinations will be mandatory for kids when they return to school this fall. A total of 37 flowering potted plants will soon decorate Main Street in the Village of Oakfield. The flowers will be paid for by residents and business owners to help bring a little color to the community. The project was spearheaded by Village Clerk Kim Staniszewski and Judy Boyle. Donors put up $25 for each potted plant and they get to place a message on it.", "provider": [{"_type": "Organization", "name": "WBTA"}], "datePublished": "2021-01-06T20:32:00.0000000Z"}, {"name": "Twitter", "url": "https://boston.cbslocal.com/tag/twitter/page/3/", "description": "Boston Police Apologize For Black History Month Tweet ...
