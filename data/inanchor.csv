Derek Johnson is facing charges of evading arrest, speeding, driving on revoked/suspended license and a stop sign violation. According to the warrant, Johnson was behind the wheel of a gray Pontiac that was stopped for running a stop sign in Kingston on Aug. 13, 2020. Despite challenges created by the pandemic, Kingston’s proposed budget for fiscal year 2021 – 2022 is looking good, City Manager David Bolling told city council this week. “For the sixth year in a row, I am presenting you with a General Fund budget that is balanced with no tax increase. I’m also very pleased to say that, for the fourth year in a row, this budget is balanced without the use of our fund balance. This maintains our steadfast commitment to operate this city on existing revenue,” Bolling said. Rockwood Police Officer Chris Marney sprung into action when a man reported being robbed on May 7. The suspect, identified as convicted felon Samuel Johnson, was going around posing as a U.S. Marshal. He’s facing 13 charges in the incident. According to warrants, Sheila Efford was outside of her Riggs Chapel Road residence with her son when Johnson showed up wearing a face mask. “He identified himself as a U.S. Marshal,” the warrant said. “He asked if there were any men in the house. She told him no there wasn’t.” A state trooper reportedly found suspected meth, heroin and prescription pills on an intoxicated driver last week. According to warrants, Trooper Justin Hamby was dispatched to a crash on Hwy. 61 near Old Hen Valley Road on May 7. “When arriving on scene and making contact with the driver Kayne A. Lowe, who was wearing a black t-shirt with gray sweat pants and black shoes,” the warrant said. “When talking to Mr. Lowe, he had slurred speech and constricted pupils. Mr. Lowe also seemed confused when talking to EMTs.” While it is good that the county offers some level of recycling, it is interesting to find out that there was no formal written county recycling policy.
